Some weights of RobertaForMaskedLM were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/codebert-base and are newly initialized: ['lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_head.layer_norm.weight', 'lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_head.layer_norm.bias', 'lm_head.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
