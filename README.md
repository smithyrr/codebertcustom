CodeBERT Pre-training Project:

Aims to pre-train a CodeBERT model for generating and completing code snippets in a specific programming language.

CodeBERT is a versatile language model that can be fine-tuned for various software engineering tasks such as code generation and code completion.(this project is to build of CodeBerts Model and train it more directly to a specific language 

Key Features:

Pre-train CodeBERT on custom datasets.

Scrape code snippets from websites.

Optimize memory usage during training with gradient accumulation or small batch sizes.

Utilize the fine-tuned model for code generation and completion tasks.



Note: This project is a work in progress and is not complete.
