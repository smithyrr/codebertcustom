CodeBERT Am3 Pre-training Project:
(MLP) 
Aims to pre-train a CodeBERT model for generating and completing code snippets in a specific programming language.
CodeBERT is a versatile language model that can be fine-tuned for various software engineering tasks such as code generation and code completion.
Key Features:

Pre-train CodeBERT on custom datasets.
Scrape code snippets from websites.
Optimize memory usage during training with gradient accumulation or small batch sizes.
Utilize the fine-tuned model for code generation and completion tasks.
Requirements:

Python 3.
Required Python libraries: transformers, pandas, and beautifulsoup4.
Dataset:

A small dataset of code snippets for pre-training is included in smalldataset.py.
Obtain larger datasets from sources such as GitHub Python Code Snippets, Java Code Snippets, Python Code Snippets, and C++ Code Snippets.
Pre-training CodeBERT:

Fine-tune the CodeBERT model on the selected dataset using the model configuration and training script found in codebertmodel.py.
You can choose between train_with_gradient_accumulation.py and train_with_small_batch_size.py for optimizing memory usage during training.
Website Scraping (Please seek permission from website owner before scraping!):

Use websiterip.py to scrape code snippets related to a specific programming language.
Modify the script to target other websites as needed.
Results:

Use the fine-tuned CodeBERT model for various software engineering tasks, such as code generation and code completion.
Extra Information:

codebertmodel.py: Python script defining the CodeBERT model.
README.md: Markdown file containing project information and documentation.
smalldataset.py: Python script defining a small dataset for training or evaluation.
websiterip.py: Python script for downloading and extracting code blocks from websites.
train_with_small_batch_size.py: Python script for training with a small batch size to reduce memory usage.
train_with_gradient_accumulation.py: Python script for training with gradient accumulation to improve stability.
Note: The train_data folder has been added, but the data inside requires preprocessing before use.
generate_description.py Script Summary:

Imports the necessary libraries, including the GPT-2 tokenizer and model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, as well as JSON and PyTorch.
Loads the pretrained GPT-2 tokenizer and model.
Defines a function called generate_description that takes a code example as input and returns a generated description.
Reads the "arma3_commands.json" file and loads its content into a variable called commands_data.
Iterates through the commands_data list and generates a new description for each command with the description "No description available" based on the command's example code.
Prints the code example and the corresponding generated description.
Writes the updated commands_data list to a new JSON file called "arma3_commands_with_descriptions.json".
generate_descriptions.py:

Reads the contents of the arma3_commands_by_functionality.json file.
Removes the leading and trailing commas from the content.
Wraps the content in square brackets ([...]) to make it a valid JSON array.
Parses the formatted content as a JSON object.
Saves the formatted content to a new JSON file named formatted_arma3_commands_by_functionality.json with proper indentation.
Note: This project is a work in progress and is not complete.
