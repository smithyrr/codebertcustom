codebertmodel.py: This is likely a Python script that defines a CodeBERT model for code generation or other natural language processing tasks.

README.md: This is a Markdown file that typically contains instructions, documentation, or other information about the project or codebase.

smalldataset.py: This is likely a Python script that defines a small dataset for training or evaluation of a machine learning model.

websiterip.py: This is likely a Python script that downloads and extracts code blocks from a website, using tools such as BeautifulSoup or Extractor.

train_with_small_batch_size.py: This is likely a Python script that trains a machine learning model with a small batch size, which can be useful for reducing memory usage during training.

train_with_gradient_accumulation.py: This is likely a Python script that trains a machine learning model with gradient accumulation, which can be useful for simulating larger batch sizes and improving training stability.



added train Data folder but all data inside is not ready and needs preprocessing
