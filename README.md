CodeBERT Pre-training Project
This project aims to pre-train a CodeBERT model for generating and completing code snippets in a specific programming language. CodeBERT is a versatile language model that can be fine-tuned for various software engineering tasks such as code generation and code completion.

Key Features
Pre-train CodeBERT on custom datasets
Scrape code snippets from websites
Optimize memory usage during training with gradient accumulation or small batch sizes
Utilize the fine-tuned model for code generation and completion tasks
Requirements
Ubuntu-based machine with at least 10GB of RAM and 8 virtual processors
Python 3
Required Python libraries: transformers, pandas, and beautifulsoup4
Dataset
A small dataset of code snippets for pre-training is included in smalldataset.py
Obtain larger datasets from sources such as GitHub Python Code Snippets, Java Code Snippets, Python Code Snippets, and C++ Code Snippets
Pre-training CodeBERT
Fine-tune the CodeBERT model on the selected dataset using the model configuration and training script found in codebertmodel.py. You can choose between train_with_gradient_accumulation.py and train_with_small_batch_size.py for optimizing memory usage during training.

Website Scraping
Use websiterip.py to scrape code snippets related to a specific programming language
Modify the script to target other websites as needed
Results
Use the fine-tuned CodeBERT model for various software engineering tasks, such as code generation and code completion.

generate_description.py Script Summary
This script imports the necessary libraries, including the GPT-2 tokenizer and model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, as well as JSON and PyTorch. It then loads the pretrained GPT-2 tokenizer and model.

The script defines a function called generate_description that takes a code example as input and returns a generated description. The function prepares an input text by adding a prompt to describe the given Arma 3 code, tokenizes the input text and creates an attention mask, generates a description using the GPT-2 model, takes into account the input_ids and attention_mask tensors, decodes the generated output, and returns the description as a string.

Next, the script reads the "arma3_commands.json" file and loads its content into a variable called commands_data. It then iterates through the commands_data list, and for each command with the description "No description available," uses the generate_description function to generate a new description based on the command's example code. The generated description replaces the existing description in the command dictionary.

Finally, the script prints the code example and the corresponding generated description, and writes the updated commands_data list to a new JSON file called "arma3_commands_with_descriptions.json".
