CodeBERT Pre-training Project
This project is aimed at pre-training a CodeBERT model to generate and complete code snippets for a specific programming language. The CodeBERT model is a powerful language model that can be fine-tuned on specific tasks related to software engineering, such as code generation and code completion.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need a machine with Ubuntu installed, at least 10GB of RAM and 8 virtual processors. You will also need Python 3 and the following Python libraries: transformers, pandas, and beautifulsoup4.

Dataset
The project includes a small dataset of code snippets to be used for pre-training. The dataset can be found in the smalldataset.py file. Additionally, a larger dataset can be obtained from sources such as GitHub Python Code Snippets, Java Code Snippets, Python Code Snippets, and C++ Code Snippets.

CodeBERT Pre-Training
The pre-training process involves fine-tuning the CodeBERT model on the selected dataset. The codebertmodel.py file contains the model configuration and the training script, while train_with_gradient_accumulation.py and train_with_small_batch_size.py provide different training options for optimizing memory usage.

Website Scraping
To obtain a dataset of code snippets related to a specific programming language, the project includes a script called websiterip.py, which uses the BeautifulSoup library to scrape code snippets from a website. The script can be easily modified to scrape code from other websites.

Results
Once the pre-training process is completed, the fine-tuned CodeBERT model can be used for various software engineering tasks, such as code generation and code completion.



Extra info

codebertmodel.py: This is likely a Python script that defines a CodeBERT model for code generation or other natural language processing tasks.

README.md: This is a Markdown file that typically contains instructions, documentation, or other information about the project or codebase.

smalldataset.py: This is likely a Python script that defines a small dataset for training or evaluation of a machine learning model.

websiterip.py: This is likely a Python script that downloads and extracts code blocks from a website, using tools such as BeautifulSoup or Extractor.

train_with_small_batch_size.py: This is likely a Python script that trains a machine learning model with a small batch size, which can be useful for reducing memory usage during training.

train_with_gradient_accumulation.py: This is likely a Python script that trains a machine learning model with gradient accumulation, which can be useful for simulating larger batch sizes and improving training stability.



added train Data folder but all data inside is not ready and needs preprocessing
